# Deep Learning for Healthcare Final Project (Team 16)
**COVID-19 CT Scan Classification with Deep Learning**

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the classification of COVID-19 cases from CT scans using deep learning techniques. The provided notebook can be executed in a Google Colab environment without requiring additional setup.

## Quickstart

1. Open the `DL4H_Team_16.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. To execute all cells, Click "Run All" in the Runtime menu.
3. The entire process should be completed in approximately 8 minutes.

## Features
- Provide `demo_mode` to run a subset in a shorter time.
- Preprocessed datasets for COVID/non-COVID cases.
- Pretrained model checkpoint for quick validation.
- The entire workflow is contained within a single notebook for ease of use.

## Requirements

- A Google Colab account.
- No external packages are required as all dependencies are handled by the notebook.

## Usage

The notebook is structured to provide a streamlined experience:

- **Data Loading**: The dataset is automatically loaded and preprocessed.
- **Model Training**: A deep learning model is trained to classify CT scans.
- **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated to assess its performance.

## Results

Upon completion, the notebook will display:

- Training and validation loss and accuracy graphs.
- Visualization of model predictions on test data.
- Further discussion and ablation experiments.
